**Submission Date:** September 2025

### üéØ Problem Statement
Modern businesses are drowning in unstructured customer data across multiple channels - support tickets, chat logs, email communications, review comments, and social media mentions. Traditional analytics only capture structured metrics like ratings and timestamps, missing the rich contextual insights buried in customer language, emotions, and specific pain points.

**The Challenge:** How can we transform scattered, unstructured customer feedback into actionable business intelligence that drives product improvements, reduces churn, and enhances customer satisfaction?

### üí° Solution Overview
The **Smart Customer Insight Engine** leverages BigQuery AI's generative and vector search capabilities to create an intelligent system that:

1. **Automatically categorizes and prioritizes** customer feedback across all channels
2. **Extracts emotional sentiment and urgency levels** from unstructured text
3. **Identifies recurring themes and emerging issues** before they become widespread problems
4. **Generates executive-ready summaries** with actionable recommendations
5. **Enables semantic search** to find similar past issues and their resolutions

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Implementation

#### Core Components:
- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Processes customer communications from multiple sources
- **AI Processing Engine**: Uses BigQuery's ML.GENERATE_TEXT and vector embeddings
- **Insight Dashboard**: Real-time analytics with natural language summaries
- **Alert System**: Proactive notifications for urgent issues

#### BigQuery AI Features Used:
1. **ML.GENERATE_TEXT()** - For content summarization and insight generation
2. **ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS()** - For semantic similarity and clustering
3. **Vector Search** - For finding related issues and solutions
4. **Text Classification** - For automated categorization and sentiment analysis

### üìä Data Sources & Schema

  -- Generate insights for new feedback
  INSERT INTO feedback_insights (
    feedback_id, sentiment_score, urgency_level, category, key_themes, summary, action_items
  )
  SELECT 
    f.feedback_id,
    
    -- Extract sentiment score
    CAST(JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(
      ML.GENERATE_TEXT(
        MODEL `project.dataset.text_model`,
        (SELECT f.raw_text || ' 
         Rate sentiment from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive).

    ) as key_themes,
    
    -- Generate summary
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(
      ML.GENERATE_TEXT(
        MODEL `project.dataset.text_model`,
        (SELECT f.raw_text || ' 
         Provide a concise 1-2 sentence summary of the main issue or feedback.' as prompt)
      ), '$.predictions[0].content'
    ) as summary,
    
    -- Generate action items
    ARRAY(
      SELECT TRIM(action) 
      FROM UNNEST(SPLIT(
        JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(
          ML.GENERATE_TEXT(
            MODEL `project.dataset.text_model`,
            (SELECT f.raw_text || ' 
             Suggest 1-3 specific action items to address this feedback.
             Return as comma-separated list.' as prompt)

    ) as action_items
    
  FROM customer_feedback f
  WHERE f.processed = FALSE;
  
  -- Mark as processed
  UPDATE customer_feedback 
  SET processed = TRUE 
  WHERE processed = FALSE;
END;
```

#### 2. Executive Summary Generation
```sql
-- Generate daily executive summary
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION GenerateExecutiveSummary(report_date DATE)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL AS (
  SELECT JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(
    ML.GENERATE_TEXT(
      MODEL `project.dataset.text_model`,
      (SELECT CONCAT(
        'Generate an executive summary for customer feedback on ', report_date, '. 
         
         Key Metrics:
         - Total feedback items: ', total_feedback, '
         - Critical issues: ', critical_count, '
         - Average sentiment: ', ROUND(avg_sentiment, 2), '
         - Top categories: ', STRING_AGG(category, ', '), '
         
         Critical Issues Summary:
         ', STRING_AGG(critical_summaries, ' ‚Ä¢ '), '
         
         Trending Themes:
         ', STRING_AGG(themes, ', '), '
         
         Create a 3-paragraph executive summary with:
         1. Overall sentiment and volume overview
         2. Critical issues requiring immediate attention
         3. Key recommendations and next steps
         
         Use professional business language suitable for C-level executives.'
      ) as prompt)
    ), '$.predictions[0].content'
  )
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      COUNT(*) as total_feedback,
      COUNTIF(urgency_level = 'critical') as critical_count,
      AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment,
      STRING_AGG(DISTINCT category) as category,
      STRING_AGG(DISTINCT CASE WHEN urgency_level = 'critical' THEN summary END) as critical_summaries,
      STRING_AGG(DISTINCT key_themes) as themes
    FROM feedback_insights fi
    JOIN customer_feedback cf ON fi.feedback_id = cf.feedback_id
    WHERE DATE(cf.timestamp) = report_date
  )
);
```

#### 3. Semantic Similar Issue Search
```sql
-- Find similar past issues using vector search
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION FindSimilarIssues(input_text STRING, limit_results INT64)
RETURNS ARRAY<STRUCT<feedback_id STRING, similarity_score FLOAT64, summary STRING>>
LANGUAGE SQL AS (
  WITH input_embedding AS (
    SELECT ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS(
      MODEL `project.dataset.embedding_model`,
      (SELECT input_text as content)
    ) as embedding
  ),
  similarity_scores AS (
    SELECT 
      fi.feedback_id,
      fi.summary,
      ML.DISTANCE(ie.embedding, fi.embeddings, 'COSINE') as similarity_score
    FROM feedback_insights fi
    CROSS JOIN input_embedding ie
    WHERE fi.embeddings IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY similarity_score ASC
    LIMIT limit_results
  )
  SELECT ARRAY_AGG(
    STRUCT(feedback_id, similarity_score, summary)
  )
  FROM similarity_scores
);
```
